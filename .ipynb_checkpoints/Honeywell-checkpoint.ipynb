The customer stated \\n\\nthat the ramp at his airport is being repaved \\n\\nand grounding points are not being re-\\n\\ninstalled.  \\n In recent years, there has been a change in \\n\\nphilosophy and practice with regard to \\n\\ngrounding. In the 1990 edition of the U.S. \\n\\nNational Fire Protection Association Standard \\n\\nfor Aircraft Fuel Servicing (NFPA 407), the \\n\\nrequirements for Ground\\ning were deleted and \\nrequirements for Bonding were clarified. \\n The practice in the United States has been \\n\\nto bond and ground, but tests have proven that \\n\\nif the aircraft and fuel truck are properly \\n\\nbonded, a grounding wire carries no electrical \\n\\ncharge at all. This is why NFPA 407 no longer \\n\\nspecifies grounding for safety during aircraft \\n\\nfueling.  The NFPA determination was based on the \\n\\nfollowing points: \\nŁ Grounding does not prevent sparking at the \\n\\nfuel surface \\nŁ Grounding is not required per NFPA 77, \\n\\nRecommended Practice on Static Electricity \\n\\nŁ Static electrical grounding points can have \\n\\nhigh resistance, making them unsuitable for \\n\\ngrounding \\nŁ The wire/cable used for grounding might not \\n\\nbe capable of conducting current in the event \\n\\nof an electrical fault in the ground support \\n\\nequipment connected to the aircraft and could \\n\\nbecome an ignition source if the wire fuses. \\n \\n The Gulfstream Ground Handling and \\n\\nServicing Handbooks, and Aircraft \\n\\nMaintenance Manuals have removed the \\n\\ngrounding requirement and call only for \\n\\nbonding the fuel source to the aircraft during \\n\\nany type of fueling or defueling operation.\\n  MAINTENANCE SALES TEAM  16  Regional Maintenance Sales Team \\nUpcoming Events November 17 Œ Forum, Reception, Dubai, UAE \\nDecember 3 Œ Forum, CMP.net, Glendale, Calif. \\nJune 8-11, 2009ŒGulfstream O\\nperators™ Conference\\nBREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    3TOP STORIES  Large-Cabin (ATA 00): Aircraft Maintenance Manual Update By Skip Weinrick, Sr. Manager, Technical Publications  \\n The Gulfstream Technical Publications departme\\nnt is continuously working on updates to the \\nmanuals to improve the accuracy of the content and ea\\nse of use. We appreciate the input from our users \\n(Customers, Engineering, Tech Ops, and Field Service \\nRepresentatives) and their efforts for contributing \\nchange requests during 2008. Anytime missing inform\\nation or incorrect information is identified, we \\nencourage you to notify us. This may be accomplis\\nhed via a Field Service Report (FSR) or directly \\nthrough the Publications Change Request (PCR) system\\n. Publications has taken an aggressive approach \\nto achieving our goals by increasing the number of \\nannual revisions to three for in-production aircraft \\nand two for out-of-production aircraft, for a total of 27 Maintenance Manual suites to be revised this year.  Technical Publications has also \\nlaunched a feasibility study for an \\non-hands validation approach with \\nthe help of the Service Facility. We are embedding te\\nchnical writers on a non-interference basis to work \\nwith technicians on the floor to better understand \\ntheir requirements and to allow them to give \\nimmediate input when a publication change is required. \\n PlaneViewŽ Cert Delta Engineering released data\\n was included in 2008 revisions and enhanced the \\naccuracy of the G350/G450 and G500/G550 Maintena\\nnce Manuals and Fault Isolation Manuals. The \\nFault Isolation Manuals were further enhanced by intr\\noducing many of the observed faults that are not \\nelectronically detected. We also enhanced the HyperNav\\n functionality that allows the technician to locate \\ncomponents, connectors, splices, ground studs, and terminal junction physical locations on the aircraft.  In addition to maintaining this aggressive revisi\\non schedule, we are also \\nstarting to develop the \\nMaintenance Manual Suite for the G650. Some of the te\\nchnical writers have already been co-located with \\nthe development engineers to begin writing the ma\\nintenance procedures for the new Rolls-Royce BR725 \\nengine.  \\n The revisions Technical Publications has accomp\\nlished to date in 2008 are \\nlisted below with a short explanation of when the revision was distributed and what was incorporated. \\n\\n \\nGII, GIIB, GIII \\n GII Rev. 73, GIIB Rev. 39, an\\nd GIII Rev. 55 manuals were distri\\nbuted April 21, 2008. 208 Publication \\nChange requests were incorporated that resulted in \\nover 320 page blocks changed.\\n GII Rev. 74, GIIB Rev. \\n40, and GIII Rev. 56 manuals are scheduled for distribution November 30, 2008.  \\nGV, G500, G550 \\n Revision 30 and 31of the GV and Revision 11 and \\n12 of the G500 and G550 manuals were distributed \\nMarch 28, 2008 and July 8, 2008, resp\\nectively.

This has resulted in failure\\n either as a result of corrosion and/or freezing in \\nflight.  \\n Each of the aircraft series has Aircraft Ma\\nintenance Manual (AMM) instructions for the \\nremoval/installation of the various Rudder Trim Compon\\nents. Included in the instruction is a callout for \\nthe application of shrinkable tube, P/N ATUM-19/6-0,\\n at the Flexible Shaft-to-Rudder Trim Actuator \\nconnections. These areas are highlighted below for th\\ne respective aircraft Rudder Trim Actuators. There \\nis an additional callout for the G150 and G200 for blac\\nk RTV (GE RTV-103) to be used as indicated in the \\nbelow illustrations.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n                      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Flexible Shaft Upper End Sealing ASTRA/SPX/G100 Flexible Shaft Lower End \\nSealing, ASTRA/SPX/G100 Flexible Shaft Upper End Sealing G150/G200 Flexible Shaft Upper End Sealing G150/G200 \\nBREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    5 The shrinkable tubing, part number ATUM-19/6-0, \\ncalled out in each of the installations is a \\nspecialized Raychem product. ATUM tubing is radiation-cross linked, heat-shrinkable, and adhesive-lined to provide environmental sealing in a wide variety of \\napplications. The internal adhesive coating, when \\nheated, melts and flows to form a \\npositive environmental seal. The co\\nating adheres to the outer tubing \\nand the surface below, creating an excellent barrier to moisture penetration.    ATUM-19/6-0 has a 3:1 shrink ratio. ATUM is the se\\nries of tubing, the 19/6 is the expansion-to-shrink \\nratio in millimeters, and the -0 is the color identifier for black. \\n Ensuring this procedure is properly accomplis\\nhed will reduce the probability of premature failure.  \\n G150® (ATA 24/49): APU Generator Grounding By Gary Schoonover, Service Engineering, Electrical/Avionics \\n\\n \\n Several G150 aircraft have reported\\n ﬁGEN LOAD UNBALANCEﬂ\\n status messages. In some \\ncases, the aircraft starts out with all generator \\n\\ncurrents reading the same and the APU generator \\n\\ncurrent slowly decreases to zero. \\n A team from Dallas troubleshot the problem to \\n\\na poor ground for the APU generator return cable \\n\\nat 10GND (see graphic). The plate to which the \\n\\nground is mounted was found\\n to be poorly bonded \\nto the aircraft structure. When the plate was \\n\\ntapped, the APU generator current indication in \\n\\nthe cockpit would jump.  \\n To correct the issue, technicians removed the \\n\\nrivets, burnished the two mating surfaces, and \\n\\nreinstalled the plate. Electr\\nical bonding practices in this area have been reviewed with production \\n\\npersonnel to ensure proper ground performance on \\n\\nfuture aircraft.  \\n If you have been experiencing load sharing issues\\n that have not responded \\nto previous maintenance \\nefforts, please consider this pote\\nntial solution. This condition is under evaluation by Gulfstream, and a \\nService Bulletin is under consideration. Any futu\\nre fleet actions will be communicated via normal \\nchannels. \\n \\n G200® (ATA 33): Operating Entry Light Switch Panel on Battery Power  By John Deputy, G150/G200 Model Manager \\n \\n An issue surrounding the operational characterist\\nics of the Entry Light Switch Panel (CMS1 Cabin \\nSystem) has been brought to our attention by a G200 aircraft operator.    With the aircraft powered down and the battery ci\\nrcuit breaker closed, depressing one of the entry \\nlight switches causes the controller (P/N 2052-1-6) to \\npower up on aircraft batte\\nry power, initiate a 10-\\nminute countdown timer and turn on the associated \\nlight within the aircraft. The deviation between the \\nelectrical drawing note and actual op\\neration comes about as a result of the length of time that the switch \\nis depressed.   \\n\\n The entry light switches are momentary switches that complete the circuit as long as the switch is \\n\\ndepressed. A momentary tap (\\n 1 second) on one of the entry light switches completes the circuit long \\nenough for the controller to recognize the request to \\npower up in battery mode. \\nHowever, by the time the \\nOperating System (OS) and application software are \\nboth running, the active low signal through that \\nentry light switch is no longer present, resultin\\ng in a case where the 10-minute countdown timer and \\n10GND LOCATION\\n \\nBREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    6associated light are unable to turn on, as both \\nof these functions are controlled from within the \\napplication software. \\n Troubleshooting revealed that if the initial switch\\n press lasts for three to four seconds, there is \\nsufficient time for the controller to complete the boot\\n-up cycle such that the OS and application software \\nare up and running. Once the application software \\nis running, the switch input can be recognized, \\nenabling the 10-minute countdown timer and determinin\\ng which light switch was depressed to close the \\nappropriate contact that turns the light on. Altern\\natively, if the controller is powered up with the \\nmomentary press on the entry light switch and is fo\\nllowed up with a second pr\\ness a couple of seconds \\nlater (now that the application software is running\\n), the 10-minute countdown timer is initiated and the \\ncorresponding light is turned on. \\n The resulting action of a single momentary tap of\\n an Entry Light switch is the controller would be \\npowered up on the battery without the 10-minute count\\ndown timer being initiated that would eventually \\nturn it off.     GII®/GIII® (ATA 80): Both Engines Rotate with Left Start Initiation  By Bob Landers, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group \\n \\n An operator contacted Gulfstream Customer Support\\n, requesting assistance with an engine starting \\nproblem on his aircraft. During left engine start, \\nwhen the start button was \\ndepressed, both engines \\nbegan rotating. When he started the right-hand engine\\n first, the start sequence was normal; he then did \\na left-hand engine start, with no problems reported.  Troubleshooting found there was 18 volts at the righ\\nt engine starter solenoid connector with the left \\nselected for start and the start bu\\ntton depressed. Next, the wire was removed from terminal 4 on the \\nstart selector switch, finding 0 volts on the termin\\nal, but there was 20 volts on the wire. The wire was \\nthen removed from TJ6P terminal H,\\n and no voltage was indicated on the terminal, but there was voltage \\non the wire.  \\n The connector was disconnected from the Rotation \\nAmplifier with voltage going to zero. Removing the \\ncannon plug from the Rotation Amplifier, technician\\ns determined there was an internal failure of the \\nunit. The Engine Rotation Amplifier, part num\\nber 26530335-01, was removed an\\nd replaced, returning operation to normal. \\n\\n \\n GIV®/G300®/G400® (ATA 27): Control Wheel Oscillation from Horizontal Stabilizer By Denny George, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group \\n \\n Recently, a GIV crew reported a control wheel osc\\nillation related to the horizontal stabilizer. The \\noperator made a visit to a maintenance facility to ha\\nve the crew™s squawk investigated: Evaluate aircraft \\nfor tail vibration, which occurs at 0.80 Mach or gr\\neater. Autopilot coupled \\nFGC 1 or 2, no aircraft \\nporpoising, occurs straight and level. Vibration stops with any pitch change.  The following was accomplished during subsequent maintenance: \\n\\n Ł The elevators were removed, inspected, and balanced.  \\n\\n Ł Both elevator number four hinge bearin\\ngs were replaced due to excessive wear  Ł Elevator curtains and attaching hardware we\\nre inspected for defects; none were found.   Ł An elevator free-play check was completed with no defects.  \\n\\n Ł Elevator trim servo and cable tensio\\nn was checked and found within limits.   Ł The primary elevator control cable rigging and c\\nable tension were found to be within limitations.   Ł Numerous access panels relating to the horizo\\nntal stabilizer and elevators were removed and the \\nexposed areas inspected for defects. No defects were found. \\n Ł Horizontal stabilizer free play was checked from si\\nde to side and the ﬁrub \\nblocksﬂ were found to be \\nwithin limits at all stabilizer settings.  \\nBREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    7 Ł The elevator actuator was removed and re\\nplaced, and the removed unit was sent out for \\nevaluation.  An aircraft evaluation flight confirmed the orig\\ninal squawk, with a few more comments: ﬁThe stab \\nappears to be loose. The horizontal stabilizer indicato\\nr needle was moving in concert with elevator inputs, \\nwith up elevator applied, stab needle would move up\\n and with down elevator input, stab needle would \\nmove down.ﬂ \\n After reviewing all maintenance actions and co\\nnsulting with Technical Operations and Service \\nEngineering personnel, it was dete\\nrmined to investigate the horizontal stabilizer actuator. The unit was \\nremoved, inspected, and found\\n to be defective. The stabilizer actuat\\nor input shaft could be turned 6 to 10 \\nrevolutions in either direction before any actuator \\nmovement was detected. There was also approximately \\n0.250 to 0.375 inches axial play when applying pre\\nssure in the extend and retract direction of the \\nactuator. These two conditions are what allowed th\\ne oscillation to stop with pitch change and the \\nstabilizer indicator needle to move in concert with the elevators.  \\n The horizontal stabilizer actuator was replaced, all \\nassociated operational chec\\nks were completed, an \\nevaluation flight was made with no defects noted, an\\nd the aircraft was returned to service. The defective \\nactuator was sent out for evaluation and failure analysis. \\n Gulfstream and Moog are investigating this di\\nscrepancy, and any future fleet action will be \\ncommunicated via normal channels. \\n \\n G350®/G450® (ATA 32/33/38/73): Forthcoming ASCs By Merlisa Harrod, Customer Support Technical Bulletin Group  \\n Following is a list of forthcoming Aircraft \\nService Changes (ASCs) for G350/G450 aircraft.  \\nASC 045: Engine Fuel and Control (ATA 73) Engine Electronic Controller (EEC) Œ T5.1 \\n\\nSoftware Upgrade \\nPurpose/Discussion: This aircraft service change upgrades \\nthe Engine Electronic Controller (EEC) \\nsoftware from T4.0 to T5.1 and incorporates a forthcoming Rolls-Royce Service Bulletin.

G350®/G450®/G500®/G550® (ATA 38): Leaking Lavatory Soap Dispensers By Denny George, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group \\n\\n \\n  Several operators have commented\\n about soap leaking out of their \\naircraft™s forward and aft lavatory \\nsoap dispensers, Adams Rite Ae\\nrospace Soap Dispenser Assembly\\n part number AR9116-DXXX. This \\ngenerally occurs only on high-altitude, long-range flights.  \\n All incidents were narrowed down \\nto servicing of the soap dispenser. The filling instructions in the \\nAdams Rite Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) stat\\ne: Fill the bottle with soap through housing. Do \\nnot overfill.  \\n The bottle capacity is listed at 5 oz. In the fault is\\nolation section of the CMM, one of the remedies for \\na bottle that does not dispense soap is to fill bottle \\nto capacity. However, when filled in this manner, the \\nbottle will leak soap due to pressurization at high al\\ntitude. The manual is not clear in exactly how much \\nsoap should be used and indicates ﬁfullﬂ and ﬁfill to capacityﬂ as the reference marks to go by.  Based on service experience, it is recommended to \\nfill the soap bottles no more than three quarters \\nfull, or 3.5 to 4.0 oz. This will prevent soap from oozin\\ng from the assembly on long, high-altitude flights. \\nWhen serviced in this manner, no problems have b\\neen noted. This informatio\\nn will be added to the next \\nrevision of the Completion Cent\\ner Maintenance Handbook (CCMH). \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Adams Rite Soap Dispenser \\nBREAKFAST MINUTES                              November 14, 2008    9GV® (ATA 32): Reminder Regarding Use of MLG Jack Pad Adapter By Bill Jones, Customer Support Mechanical Systems Group  \\n Recently, a GV operator jacked the aircraft witho\\nut the proper jack pad adapter and damaged the \\nmain landing gear (MLG) axle. As a result, we are pu\\nblishing this reminder of the importance of using \\nthe correct adapter when jacking the aircraft.  \\n The latest style jack pad adapter was installed \\nby Aircraft Service Change (ASC) 155 for aircraft 501-\\n619 and is a production standard from aircraft 620 \\nand subsequent. This modification removes the \\nexisting MLG axle bushings, P/N 1159LM50156-1, and inst\\nalls a Foreign Object Debris (FOD) cap at each \\nMLG axle jack point, which helps to minimize th\\ne possibility of corrosion in the lower MLG axle. \\nAdditionally, this modification changes the jack\\n pad adapter assembly \\nto a new part number, \\n1159GSE50214-3. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   GV®/G500®/G550® (ATA 00): Rolls-Royce Update By Paul Tracy, Senior Customer Servic\\nes Representative, Rolls-Royce Savannah \\n \\n Rolls-Royce recently issued update information on\\n current items.

Silva de Lapuerta (Rapporteur), President of the Chamber, G.Arestis, J.C. Bonichot, A. Arabadjiev and J.L. da Cruz Vilaa, Judges, Advocate General: P. Mengozzi, Registrar: K. Malacek, Administrator, having regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 6December2012, after considering the observations submitted on behalf of: Amazon.com International Sales Inc., Amazon EU Srl, Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH and Amazon Logistik GmbH, by G.Kucsko and U.Brger, Rechtsanwlte, and by B.Van Asbroeck, avocat, Austro-Mechana Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung mechanisch-musikalischer Urheberrechte Gesellschaft mbH, by M.Walter, Rechtsanwalt, and U.Sedlaczek, the Austrian Government, by A.Posch, acting as Agent, the French Government, by G.de Bergues and S.Menez, acting as Agents, the Polish Government, by B.Majczyna, M.Szpunar and M.Drwicki, acting as Agents, the Finnish Government, by M.Pere, acting as Agent, the European Commission, by J.Samnadda and F.Bulst, acting as Agents, after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 7 March 2013, gives the following Judgment 1This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (OJ 2001 L167, p.10).  2The request was made in proceedings brought by Amazon.com International Sales Inc., Amazon EU Srl, Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, in liquidation, and Amazon Logistik GmbH (together Amazon) against Austro-Mechana Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung mechanisch-musikalischer Urheberrechte Gesellschaft mbH (Austro-Mechana) concerning a demand by the latter for payment of the remuneration due as a result of the placing on the market of recording media under the Austrian legislation.  Legal context European Union law 3According to recitals 10, 11 and 35 in the preamble to Directive 2001/29:  (10)If authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive an appropriate reward for the use of their work, as must producers in order to be able to finance this work. The investment required to produce products such as phonograms, films or multimedia products, and services such as on-demand services, is considerable. Adequate legal protection of intellectual property rights is necessary in order to guarantee the availability of such a reward and provide the opportunity for satisfactory returns on this investment.  (11)A rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers.   (35)In certain cases of exceptions or limitations, rightholders should receive fair compensation to compensate them adequately for the use made of their protected works or other subject-matter. When determining the form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such fair compensation, account should be taken of the particular circumstances of each case. When evaluating these circumstances, a valuable criterion would be the possible harm to the rightholders resulting from the act in question. In cases where rightholders have already received payment in some other form, for instance as part of a licence fee, no specific or separate payment may be due. The level of fair compensation should take full account of the degree of use of technological protection measures referred to in this Directive. In certain situations where the prejudice to the rightholder would be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise. 4Article 2 of that directive provides:  Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part:  (a)for authors, of their works;  (b)for performers, of fixations of their performances;  (c)for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;  (d)for the producers of the first fixations of films, in respect of the original and copies of their films;  (e)for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.  5Article 5 of that directive, entitled Exemptions and restrictions, provides in paragraph 2:  Member States may provide for exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right provided for in Article 2 in the following cases:   (b)in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation which takes account of the application or non-application of technological measures referred to in Article 6 to the work or subject-matter concerned;   Austrian law 6Paragraph 42 of the Law on Copyright (Urheberrechtsgesetz) of 9 April 1936 (BGBl. 111/1936), as amended by the new law of 2003 on copyright (Urheberrechtsgesetz-Novelle 2003 BGBl. I, 32/2003, the UrhG), reads:  1.Any person may make single copies, on paper or a similar medium, of a work for personal use.  4.Any natural person may make single copies of a work on media other than those mentioned in subparagraph 1 for private use and for purposes which are not directly or indirectly commercial.   7Article 42b of the UrhG provides:  1.Where it is to be anticipated that, by reason of its nature, a work which has been broadcast, made available to the public or captured on an image or sound recording medium manufactured for commercial purposes will be reproduced for personal or private use by being recorded on an image or sound recording medium pursuant to Paragraph42(2) to (7), the author shall be entitled to equitable remuneration (blank cassette levy) in respect of recording material placed on the domestic market on a commercial basis and for consideration; blank image or sound recording media suitable for such reproduction or other image or sound recording media intended for that purpose shall be deemed to constitute recording material.  3.The following persons shall be required to pay equitable remuneration: (1)as regards remuneration for blank cassettes and equipment, persons who, acting on a commercial basis and for consideration, are first to place the recording material or reproduction equipment on the market in national territory;  5.Only copyright collecting societies can exercise the right to remuneration laid down in subparagraphs 1 and 2. 6.Copyright collecting societies shall be required to repay the equitable remuneration: (1) to persons who export abroad recording media or equipment before it is sold to the final consumer; (2) to persons who use recording media for a reproduction with the authorisation of the rightholder; indications to this effect are sufficient.  8Paragraph 13 of the Austrian Law on collecting societies (Verwertungsgesellschaftengesetz; the VerwGesG) of 13 January 2006 (BGBl. I, 9/2006), provides:  1.Collecting societies may create institutions for social and cultural purposes for the beneficiaries which they represent and for their family members. 2.Collecting societies which exercise the right to remuneration for blank cassettes shall create institutions for social or cultural purposes and pay to them 50% of the funds generated by that remuneration, minus the relevant administration costs.  3.Collecting societies must establish strict rules concerning the sums paid by their institutions for social and cultural purposes. 4.As regards the funds paid to social and cultural institutions deriving from remuneration in respect of blank cassettes, the federal Chancellor may determine, by regulation, the circumstances to be taken into account by the rules to be established under subparagraph 3. That regulation must ensure, inter alia, that: (1)there is a fair balance between the sums allocated to social institutions and those allocated to cultural institutions; (2)in the case of social establishments, it is possible, primarily, to provide support for rightholders suffering hardship; (3)the sums allocated to cultural establishments are used to promote the interests of rightholders.  The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling 9Austro-Mechana is a copyright collecting society which exercises rights of authors and holders of related rights to receive payment of the remuneration for recording media under Paragraph 42b(1) of the UhrG. 10Amazon is an international group which sells products via the internet, including recording media within the meaning of the above provision.  11In response to orders placed via the internet by customers in Austria who concluded contracts for that purpose, initially with Amazon.com International Sales Inc., established in the United States, and subsequently with Amazon EU Srl, established in Luxembourg, from May 2006 onwards Amazon placed recording media on the market in Austria within the meaning of Paragraph 42b(1) of the UhrG.  12Austro-Mechana brought an action against Amazon before the Handelsgericht Wien for the payment on the basis of joint and several liability of equitable remuneration within the meaning of Paragraph 42b(1) of the UhrG for recording media placed on the market in Austria from 2002 to 2004.  13The amount claimed by Austro-Mechana for recording media placed on the market in the first half of 2004 was EUR1856275. For the remainder of the period to which its claim for payment relates, Austro-Mechana sought an order requiring Amazon to provide the accounting data necessary for it to quantify its claim. 14In its interim judgment, the Handelsgericht Wien granted the application for an order to produce accounts and reserved its decision on the claim for payment. As that judgment was upheld on appeal, Amazon brought the matter before the Oberster Gerichtshof as the court of final resort. 15It is against that background that the Oberster Gerichtshof decided to stay the proceedings before it and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: (1)Can a legislative scheme be regarded as establishing fair compensation for the purposes of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, where (a)the persons entitled under Article 2 of Directive 2001/29 have a right to equitable remuneration, exercisable only through a collecting society, against persons who, acting on a commercial basis and for remuneration, are first to place on the domestic market recording media capable of reproducing the works of the rightholders, (b)this right applies irrespective of whether the media are marketed to intermediaries, to natural or legal persons for use other than for private purposes or to natural persons for use for private purposes, and  (c)the person who uses the media for reproduction with the authorisation of the rightholder or who prior to its sale to the final consumer re-exports the media has an enforceable right against the collecting society to obtain reimbursement of the remuneration (2)If Question 1 is answered in the negative: (a)Does a scheme establish fair compensation for the purposes of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 if the right specified in Question 1(a) applies only where recording media are marketed to natural persons who use the recording media to make reproductions for private purposes (b)If Question 2(a) is answered in the affirmative:  Where recording media are marketed to natural persons must it be assumed until the contrary is proven that they will use such media with a view to making reproductions for private purposes (3)If Question 1 or 2(a) is answered in the affirmative: Does it follow from Article 5 of Directive 2001/29 or other provisions of EU law that the right to be exercised by a collecting society to payment of fair compensation does not apply if, in relation to half of the funds received, the collecting society is required by law not to pay these to the persons entitled to compensation but to distribute them to social and cultural institutions (4)If Question 1 or 2(a) is answered in the affirmative: Does Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 or other provision of EU law preclude the right to be exercised by a collecting society to payment of fair compensation if in another Member State  possibly on a basis not in conformity with EU law  equitable remuneration for putting the media on the market has already been paid  The questions referred for a preliminary ruling The first question 16By its first question, the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in national territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision. 17In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, under Article 2 of that directive, the Member States are to provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of their works, of fixations of their performances, of their phonograms, of the original and copies of their films and of fixations of their broadcasts.  18However, under Article 5(2)(b) of that directive, Member States may provide for an exception to that exclusive reproduction right in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial (so-called private copying exception).  19The Court has held that, where Member States decide to introduce the private copying exception into their national law, they are required, in particular, to provide, pursuant to Article 5(2)(b), for the payment of fair compensation to holders of the exclusive right of reproduction (see Case C467/08 Padawan [2010] ECR I10055, paragraph 30, and Case C462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie [2011] ECR I5331, paragraph 22). 20The Court has also held that, since the provisions of Directive 2001/29 do not expressly address the issue of who is to pay that compensation, the Member States enjoy broad discretion when determining who must discharge that obligation (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 23). The same is true of the form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such compensation. 21In the absence of sufficiently precise Community criteria in a directive to delimit the obligations under the directive, it is for the Member States to determine, in their own territory, what are the most relevant criteria for ensuring, within the limits imposed by European Union law and in particular by the directive concerned, compliance with that directive (see, as regards the derogation from theexclusive public lending right under Council Directive 92/100/EEC of 19November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (OJ 1992 L 346, p. 61), CaseC36/05 Commission v Spain [2006] ECR I10313, paragraph 33 and case-law cited).  22As stated in recital 35 of Directive 2001/29, when determining the form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such fair compensation, account should be taken of the particular circumstances of each case.  23As regards the private copying exception under Article 5(2)(b) of that directive, the Court has held that, since the person who has caused the harm to the holder of the exclusive right of reproduction is the person who, for his private use, reproduces a protected work without seeking prior authorisation from that rightholder, it is, in principle, for that person to make good the harm related to that copying by financing the compensation which will be paid to that rightholder (Padawan, paragraph 45, and Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 26).  24The Court has however accepted that, given the practical difficulties in identifying private users and obliging them to compensate the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction for the harm caused to them, it is open to the Member States to establish a private copying levy for the purposes of financing fair compensation, chargeable not to the private persons concerned but to those who have the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and who, on that basis, in law or in fact, make that equipment available to private users or who provide copying services for them. Under such a system, it is the persons having that equipment who must discharge the private copying levy (Padawan, paragraph 46, and Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 27).  25The Court has, further, pointed out that, since that system enables the persons responsible for payment to pass on the amount of the private copying levy in the price charged for making the reproduction equipment, devices and media available, or in the price for the copying service supplied, the burden of the levy will ultimately be borne by the private user who pays that price, in a way consistent with the fair balance between the interests of the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction and those of the users of the protected subject-matter (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 28).  26In the present case, in the system established by Paragraph 42b of the UrhG for the financing of fair compensation within the meaning of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, the private copying levy is payable by those who make available, for commercial purposes and for consideration, recording media suitable for reproduction.  27In principle, such a system, as has already been pointed out in paragraph 25 of the present judgment, enables the persons responsible for payment to pass on the amount of that levy in the sale price of those media, so that the burden of the levy is ultimately borne, in accordance with the requirement of a fair balance, by the private user who pays that price, if such a user is the final recipient.  28The Court has held that a system for financing fair compensation such as that described in paragraphs 24 and 25 of this judgment is compatible with the requirements of a fair balance only if the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media concerned are liable to be used for private copying and, therefore, are likely to cause harm to the author of the protected work. There is therefore, having regard to those requirements, a necessary link between the application of the private copying levy to the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and their use for private copying, such that the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to all types of digital reproduction equipment, devices and media, including in the case where they are acquired by persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying, does not comply with Article 5(2) of Directive 2001/29 (Padawan, paragraphs 52 and 53). 29The system at issue in the main proceedings amounts to the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to recording media suitable for reproduction, including in the case where the final use thereof does not fall within the case covered by Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29.  30The question therefore arises as to whether, in such a situation, a right to reimbursement of the levy paid allows the restoration of the fair balance which is to be struck, according to the requirements of Directive 2001/29, between the interests of the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction and those of the users of the protected subject-matter. 31In that regard, it must be held that a system of financing fair compensation consisting in the indiscriminate application of a private copying levy on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, together with such a right to reimbursement, provided that that right is effective and does not make it excessively difficult to repay the levy paid, may prove to be consistent with Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, where the practical difficulties described in paragraph 24 of the present judgment or other similar difficulties justify its application. 32If a Member State has introduced a private copying exception into its national law, it must ensure, in accordance with its territorial competence, the effective recovery of the fair compensation for the harm suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction by reason of the reproduction of protected works by final users who reside on the territory of that State (see, to that effect, Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 36). Thus, where such recovery presents difficulties, the Member State concerned is also required to resolve them by taking into account the circumstances of each case.  33However, where there are no practical difficulties, or where such difficulties are not sufficient, the necessary link between the application of the private copying levy on media, on the one hand, and the use of those media for the purposes of private reproduction, on the other, is absent, so that the indiscriminate application of that levy is not justified and does not reflect the fair balance to be struck between the interests of the rightholders and those of the users of the protected subject-matter.  34It is for the national court to verify, in the light of the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by Directive 2001/29, whether the practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and, if so, whether the right to reimbursement of any levies paid in cases other than that under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 is effective and does not make repayment of those levies excessively difficult. 35In the present case, the referring court must verify, first of all, whether the indiscriminate application of a private copying levy on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction is warranted by sufficient practical difficulties in all cases. In that context, account must be taken of the scope, the effectiveness, the availability, the publicisation and the simplicity of use of the a priori exemption mentioned by Austro-Mechana in its written observations and at the hearing.  36Secondly, the referring court must also verify that the scope, the effectiveness, the availability, the publicisation and the simplicity of use of the right to reimbursement allow the correction of any imbalances created by the system in order to respond to the practical difficulties observed. In that regard, it must be observed that the referring court itself stresses that the cases of reimbursement are not limited to those expressly covered by Paragraph 42(b)(6) of the UrhG.  37In the light of the foregoing observations, the answer to the first question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in national territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision, where, having regard to the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by Directive 2001/29, which it is for the national court to verify, practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and the right to reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment of the levies paid excessively difficult. The second question 38Since the second question is dependent on the first question and the answer to the first question is a matter for the discretion of the referring court, the second question must also be answered.  39By its second question the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the establishment by a Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of recording media suitable for reproduction in the case of the marketing of such media to natural persons, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy imposed on persons who first place such media on the market in their territory for commercial purposes and for consideration. 40In that regard, it must be held that, in the context of the wide discretion enjoyed by the Member States in determining the form, the detailed arrangements and the possible level of such compensation, it is legitimate for them to provide for presumptions, inter alia, as was observed in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, where the actual collection of the fair compensation to make good the damage suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction on their territory presents difficulties.  41In the context of systems of financing similar to that established by Paragraph 42b of the UrhG, the Court has held that, where the recording media capable of being used for reproduction have been made available to natural persons for private purposes it is unnecessary to show that they have in fact made private copies with the help of those media and have therefore actually caused harm to the holder of the exclusive right of reproduction, given that those natural persons are rightly presumed to benefit fully from the making available of those media, that is to say that they are deemed to take full advantage of the functions associated with that equipment, including copying (Padawan, paragraphs 54 and 55). 42The mere fact that those media are suitable for making copies is sufficient to justify the application of the private copying levy, provided that the media have been made available to natural persons as private users (Padawan, paragraph 56).  43Given the practical difficulties connected with the determination of the private purpose of the use of a recording medium suitable for reproduction, the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of such use when that medium is made available to a natural person is, in principle, justified and reflects the fair balance to be struck between the interests of the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction and those of the users of the protected subject-matter.  44It is for the national court to verify, in the light of the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by Directive 2001/29, whether the practical difficulties involved in determining whether the purpose of the use of the media at issue is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and, in any event, whether the presumption established results in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29.  45In those circumstances, the answer to the second question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy to be borne by persons who first place recording media suitable for reproduction on the market in the territory of the Member State concerned for commercial purposes and for consideration, that provision does not preclude the establishment by that Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of such media where they are marketed to natural persons, where the practical difficulties of determining whether the purpose of the use of the media in question is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and provided that the presumption established does not result in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in that provision. The third question 46By its third question, the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision, or the private copying levy intended to finance such compensation, may be excluded if half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levies is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled.  47In that connection, it must be borne in mind that the notion and level of fair compensation under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 are linked to the harm resulting for the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction from the reproduction for private use of their protected works without their authorisation. From that perspective, fair compensation must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by such rightholders and must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of the harm caused to them by the introduction of the private copying exception (Padawan, paragraphs 40 and 42).  48Moreover, the Court has held that, with regard to the right to fair compensation payable to holders of the exclusive right of reproduction under the private copying exception, it does not follow from any provision of Directive 2001/29 that the European Union legislature envisaged the possibility of that right being waived by the person entitled to it (jCase C277/10 Luksan [2012] ECR, paragraph 105).  49However, as the Advocate General observed in point 76 of his opinion, Directive 2001/29 does not require Member States which have introduced the private copying exception into their national law to pay those entitled to such fair compensation all the fair compensation in cash and does not preclude those Member States from providing, in the exercise of the wide discretion which they enjoy, that part of that compensation be provided in the form of indirect compensation. 50In that regard, the fact that the fair compensation must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by holders of the exclusive right of reproduction by reason of the introduction of the private copying exception, and must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of such harm, does not constitute an obstacle to the indirect payment to those entitled, through the intermediary of social and cultural establishments set up for their benefit, of a part of the revenue intended for fair compensation. 51Indeed, as the Advocate General observed in point 76 of his opinion, remuneration systems for private copying are at present necessarily imprecise with regard to most recording media, in that it is impossible in practice to determine which work was reproduced by which user and on which medium.  52Moreover, it must be observed that such a system of indirect collection of fair compensation by those entitled to it meets one of the objectives of the appropriate legal protection of intellectual property rights under Directive 2001/29, which is, as is apparent from recitals 10 and 11 of that directive, to ensure that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources to continue their creative and artistic work and to safeguard the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers.  53Consequently, the fact that a part of the revenue intended for fair compensation under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 is intended for social and cultural establishments set up for the benefit of those entitled to such compensation is not in itself contrary to the objective of that compensation, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify.  54It would not be consistent with the objective of that compensation for such establishments to grant their benefits to persons other than those entitled or to exclude, de jure or de facto, those who do not have the nationality of the Member State concerned.  55In the light of the foregoing observations, the answer to the third question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision or the private copying levy intended to finance that compensation cannot be excluded by reason of the fact that half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levy is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify. The fourth question 56By its fourth question, the referring court seeks to know, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision, may be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.  57In that regard, it must be borne in mind that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 imposes on a Member State which has introduced the private copying exception into its national law an obligation to achieve a certain result, in the sense that that State must ensure, within the framework of its powers, that the fair compensation intended to compensate the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction harmed for the prejudice sustained is actually recovered, especially if that harm arose on the territory of that Member State (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 34).  58Since it is in principle for the final users who, for their private use, reproduce a protected work without seeking prior authorisation from the holder of the exclusive right of reproduction, thereby causing him harm, to make good that harm, it can be assumed that the harm for which reparation is to be made arose on the territory of the Member State in which those final users reside (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 35).  59It follows that, if a Member State has introduced an exception for private copying into its national law and if the final users who, on a private basis, reproduce a protected work reside on its territory, that Member State must ensure, in accordance with its territorial competence, the effective recovery of the fair compensation for the harm suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction on the territory of that State (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 36). 60Moreover, it must be recalled that the system of recovery chosen by the Member State concerned cannot relieve that Member State of the obligation to achieve the certain result of ensuring that the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction who have suffered harm actually receive payment of fair compensation for the prejudice which arose on its territory (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 39). 61In that regard, it is of no bearing on that obligation that, in the case of distance selling arrangements, the commercial seller who makes available reproduction equipment, devices and media to purchasers residing on the territory of that Member State, as final users, is established in another Member State (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 40). 62In the light of the fact that, as observed in paragraph 47 of the present judgment, fair compensation must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction by reason of the introduction of the private copying exception and must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of such harm, it cannot be validly argued that the transfer from one Member State to another Member State of recording media suitable for reproduction can increase the harm caused to such rightholders. 63Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 provides for fair compensation, not for the placing on the market of recording media suitable for reproduction, but in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial. There is no such reproduction in the case of a transfer from one Member State to another Member State of recording media suitable for reproduction. 64Given that a Member State which has introduced the private copying exception into its national law and in which the final users who privately reproduce a protected work live must ensure, in accordance with its territorial competence, the effective recovery of the fair compensation for the harm suffered by those entitled, the fact that a levy intended to finance that compensation has already been paid in another Member State cannot be relied on to exclude the payment in the first Member State of such compensation or of the levy intended to finance it.  65However, a person who has previously paid that levy in a Member State which does not have territorial competence may request its repayment in accordance with its national law.  66In the light of the foregoing observations, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision may not be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.  Costs 67Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.  On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in its territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision, where, having regard to the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by that directive, which it is for the national court to verify, practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and the right to reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment of the levies paid excessively difficult. 2.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy to be borne by persons who first place recording media suitable for reproduction on the market in the territory of the Member State concerned for commercial purposes and for consideration, that provision does not preclude the establishment by that Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of such media where they are marketed to natural persons, where the practical difficulties of determining whether the purpose of the use of the media in question is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and provided that the presumption established does not result in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in that provision.  3.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision or the private copying levy intended to finance that compensation cannot be excluded by reason of the fact that half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levy is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify. 4.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision may not be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.

Malacek, Administrator, having regard to the written procedure and further to the hearing on 6December2012, after considering the observations submitted on behalf of: Amazon.com International Sales Inc., Amazon EU Srl, Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH and Amazon Logistik GmbH, by G.Kucsko and U.Brger, Rechtsanwlte, and by B.Van Asbroeck, avocat, Austro-Mechana Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung mechanisch-musikalischer Urheberrechte Gesellschaft mbH, by M.Walter, Rechtsanwalt, and U.Sedlaczek, the Austrian Government, by A.Posch, acting as Agent, the French Government, by G.de Bergues and S.Menez, acting as Agents, the Polish Government, by B.Majczyna, M.Szpunar and M.Drwicki, acting as Agents, the Finnish Government, by M.Pere, acting as Agent, the European Commission, by J.Samnadda and F.Bulst, acting as Agents, after hearing the Opinion of the Advocate General at the sitting on 7 March 2013, gives the following Judgment 1This request for a preliminary ruling concerns the interpretation of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society (OJ 2001 L167, p.10).  2The request was made in proceedings brought by Amazon.com International Sales Inc., Amazon EU Srl, Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, in liquidation, and Amazon Logistik GmbH (together Amazon) against Austro-Mechana Gesellschaft zur Wahrnehmung mechanisch-musikalischer Urheberrechte Gesellschaft mbH (Austro-Mechana) concerning a demand by the latter for payment of the remuneration due as a result of the placing on the market of recording media under the Austrian legislation.  Legal context European Union law 3According to recitals 10, 11 and 35 in the preamble to Directive 2001/29:  (10)If authors or performers are to continue their creative and artistic work, they have to receive an appropriate reward for the use of their work, as must producers in order to be able to finance this work. The investment required to produce products such as phonograms, films or multimedia products, and services such as on-demand services, is considerable. Adequate legal protection of intellectual property rights is necessary in order to guarantee the availability of such a reward and provide the opportunity for satisfactory returns on this investment.  (11)A rigorous, effective system for the protection of copyright and related rights is one of the main ways of ensuring that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources and of safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers.   (35)In certain cases of exceptions or limitations, rightholders should receive fair compensation to compensate them adequately for the use made of their protected works or other subject-matter. When determining the form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such fair compensation, account should be taken of the particular circumstances of each case. When evaluating these circumstances, a valuable criterion would be the possible harm to the rightholders resulting from the act in question. In cases where rightholders have already received payment in some other form, for instance as part of a licence fee, no specific or separate payment may be due. The level of fair compensation should take full account of the degree of use of technological protection measures referred to in this Directive. In certain situations where the prejudice to the rightholder would be minimal, no obligation for payment may arise. 4Article 2 of that directive provides:  Member States shall provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part:  (a)for authors, of their works;  (b)for performers, of fixations of their performances;  (c)for phonogram producers, of their phonograms;  (d)for the producers of the first fixations of films, in respect of the original and copies of their films;  (e)for broadcasting organisations, of fixations of their broadcasts, whether those broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite.  5Article 5 of that directive, entitled Exemptions and restrictions, provides in paragraph 2:  Member States may provide for exceptions or limitations to the reproduction right provided for in Article 2 in the following cases:   (b)in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial, on condition that the rightholders receive fair compensation which takes account of the application or non-application of technological measures referred to in Article 6 to the work or subject-matter concerned;   Austrian law 6Paragraph 42 of the Law on Copyright (Urheberrechtsgesetz) of 9 April 1936 (BGBl. 111/1936), as amended by the new law of 2003 on copyright (Urheberrechtsgesetz-Novelle 2003 BGBl. I, 32/2003, the UrhG), reads:  1.Any person may make single copies, on paper or a similar medium, of a work for personal use.  4.Any natural person may make single copies of a work on media other than those mentioned in subparagraph 1 for private use and for purposes which are not directly or indirectly commercial.   7Article 42b of the UrhG provides:  1.Where it is to be anticipated that, by reason of its nature, a work which has been broadcast, made available to the public or captured on an image or sound recording medium manufactured for commercial purposes will be reproduced for personal or private use by being recorded on an image or sound recording medium pursuant to Paragraph42(2) to (7), the author shall be entitled to equitable remuneration (blank cassette levy) in respect of recording material placed on the domestic market on a commercial basis and for consideration; blank image or sound recording media suitable for such reproduction or other image or sound recording media intended for that purpose shall be deemed to constitute recording material.  3.The following persons shall be required to pay equitable remuneration: (1)as regards remuneration for blank cassettes and equipment, persons who, acting on a commercial basis and for consideration, are first to place the recording material or reproduction equipment on the market in national territory;  5.Only copyright collecting societies can exercise the right to remuneration laid down in subparagraphs 1 and 2. 6.Copyright collecting societies shall be required to repay the equitable remuneration: (1) to persons who export abroad recording media or equipment before it is sold to the final consumer; (2) to persons who use recording media for a reproduction with the authorisation of the rightholder; indications to this effect are sufficient.  8Paragraph 13 of the Austrian Law on collecting societies (Verwertungsgesellschaftengesetz; the VerwGesG) of 13 January 2006 (BGBl. I, 9/2006), provides:  1.Collecting societies may create institutions for social and cultural purposes for the beneficiaries which they represent and for their family members. 2.Collecting societies which exercise the right to remuneration for blank cassettes shall create institutions for social or cultural purposes and pay to them 50% of the funds generated by that remuneration, minus the relevant administration costs.  3.Collecting societies must establish strict rules concerning the sums paid by their institutions for social and cultural purposes. 4.As regards the funds paid to social and cultural institutions deriving from remuneration in respect of blank cassettes, the federal Chancellor may determine, by regulation, the circumstances to be taken into account by the rules to be established under subparagraph 3. That regulation must ensure, inter alia, that: (1)there is a fair balance between the sums allocated to social institutions and those allocated to cultural institutions; (2)in the case of social establishments, it is possible, primarily, to provide support for rightholders suffering hardship; (3)the sums allocated to cultural establishments are used to promote the interests of rightholders.  The dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred for a preliminary ruling 9Austro-Mechana is a copyright collecting society which exercises rights of authors and holders of related rights to receive payment of the remuneration for recording media under Paragraph 42b(1) of the UhrG. 10Amazon is an international group which sells products via the internet, including recording media within the meaning of the above provision.  11In response to orders placed via the internet by customers in Austria who concluded contracts for that purpose, initially with Amazon.com International Sales Inc., established in the United States, and subsequently with Amazon EU Srl, established in Luxembourg, from May 2006 onwards Amazon placed recording media on the market in Austria within the meaning of Paragraph 42b(1) of the UhrG.  12Austro-Mechana brought an action against Amazon before the Handelsgericht Wien for the payment on the basis of joint and several liability of equitable remuneration within the meaning of Paragraph 42b(1) of the UhrG for recording media placed on the market in Austria from 2002 to 2004.  13The amount claimed by Austro-Mechana for recording media placed on the market in the first half of 2004 was EUR1856275. For the remainder of the period to which its claim for payment relates, Austro-Mechana sought an order requiring Amazon to provide the accounting data necessary for it to quantify its claim. 14In its interim judgment, the Handelsgericht Wien granted the application for an order to produce accounts and reserved its decision on the claim for payment. As that judgment was upheld on appeal, Amazon brought the matter before the Oberster Gerichtshof as the court of final resort. 15It is against that background that the Oberster Gerichtshof decided to stay the proceedings before it and to refer the following questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling: (1)Can a legislative scheme be regarded as establishing fair compensation for the purposes of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, where (a)the persons entitled under Article 2 of Directive 2001/29 have a right to equitable remuneration, exercisable only through a collecting society, against persons who, acting on a commercial basis and for remuneration, are first to place on the domestic market recording media capable of reproducing the works of the rightholders, (b)this right applies irrespective of whether the media are marketed to intermediaries, to natural or legal persons for use other than for private purposes or to natural persons for use for private purposes, and  (c)the person who uses the media for reproduction with the authorisation of the rightholder or who prior to its sale to the final consumer re-exports the media has an enforceable right against the collecting society to obtain reimbursement of the remuneration (2)If Question 1 is answered in the negative: (a)Does a scheme establish fair compensation for the purposes of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 if the right specified in Question 1(a) applies only where recording media are marketed to natural persons who use the recording media to make reproductions for private purposes (b)If Question 2(a) is answered in the affirmative:  Where recording media are marketed to natural persons must it be assumed until the contrary is proven that they will use such media with a view to making reproductions for private purposes (3)If Question 1 or 2(a) is answered in the affirmative: Does it follow from Article 5 of Directive 2001/29 or other provisions of EU law that the right to be exercised by a collecting society to payment of fair compensation does not apply if, in relation to half of the funds received, the collecting society is required by law not to pay these to the persons entitled to compensation but to distribute them to social and cultural institutions (4)If Question 1 or 2(a) is answered in the affirmative: Does Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 or other provision of EU law preclude the right to be exercised by a collecting society to payment of fair compensation if in another Member State  possibly on a basis not in conformity with EU law  equitable remuneration for putting the media on the market has already been paid  The questions referred for a preliminary ruling The first question 16By its first question, the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in national territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision. 17In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, under Article 2 of that directive, the Member States are to provide for the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit direct or indirect, temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part of their works, of fixations of their performances, of their phonograms, of the original and copies of their films and of fixations of their broadcasts.  18However, under Article 5(2)(b) of that directive, Member States may provide for an exception to that exclusive reproduction right in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial (so-called private copying exception).  19The Court has held that, where Member States decide to introduce the private copying exception into their national law, they are required, in particular, to provide, pursuant to Article 5(2)(b), for the payment of fair compensation to holders of the exclusive right of reproduction (see Case C467/08 Padawan [2010] ECR I10055, paragraph 30, and Case C462/09 Stichting de Thuiskopie [2011] ECR I5331, paragraph 22). 20The Court has also held that, since the provisions of Directive 2001/29 do not expressly address the issue of who is to pay that compensation, the Member States enjoy broad discretion when determining who must discharge that obligation (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 23). The same is true of the form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such compensation. 21In the absence of sufficiently precise Community criteria in a directive to delimit the obligations under the directive, it is for the Member States to determine, in their own territory, what are the most relevant criteria for ensuring, within the limits imposed by European Union law and in particular by the directive concerned, compliance with that directive (see, as regards the derogation from theexclusive public lending right under Council Directive 92/100/EEC of 19November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (OJ 1992 L 346, p. 61), CaseC36/05 Commission v Spain [2006] ECR I10313, paragraph 33 and case-law cited).  22As stated in recital 35 of Directive 2001/29, when determining the form, detailed arrangements and possible level of such fair compensation, account should be taken of the particular circumstances of each case.  23As regards the private copying exception under Article 5(2)(b) of that directive, the Court has held that, since the person who has caused the harm to the holder of the exclusive right of reproduction is the person who, for his private use, reproduces a protected work without seeking prior authorisation from that rightholder, it is, in principle, for that person to make good the harm related to that copying by financing the compensation which will be paid to that rightholder (Padawan, paragraph 45, and Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 26).  24The Court has however accepted that, given the practical difficulties in identifying private users and obliging them to compensate the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction for the harm caused to them, it is open to the Member States to establish a private copying levy for the purposes of financing fair compensation, chargeable not to the private persons concerned but to those who have the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and who, on that basis, in law or in fact, make that equipment available to private users or who provide copying services for them. Under such a system, it is the persons having that equipment who must discharge the private copying levy (Padawan, paragraph 46, and Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 27).  25The Court has, further, pointed out that, since that system enables the persons responsible for payment to pass on the amount of the private copying levy in the price charged for making the reproduction equipment, devices and media available, or in the price for the copying service supplied, the burden of the levy will ultimately be borne by the private user who pays that price, in a way consistent with the fair balance between the interests of the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction and those of the users of the protected subject-matter (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 28).  26In the present case, in the system established by Paragraph 42b of the UrhG for the financing of fair compensation within the meaning of Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, the private copying levy is payable by those who make available, for commercial purposes and for consideration, recording media suitable for reproduction.  27In principle, such a system, as has already been pointed out in paragraph 25 of the present judgment, enables the persons responsible for payment to pass on the amount of that levy in the sale price of those media, so that the burden of the levy is ultimately borne, in accordance with the requirement of a fair balance, by the private user who pays that price, if such a user is the final recipient.  28The Court has held that a system for financing fair compensation such as that described in paragraphs 24 and 25 of this judgment is compatible with the requirements of a fair balance only if the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media concerned are liable to be used for private copying and, therefore, are likely to cause harm to the author of the protected work. There is therefore, having regard to those requirements, a necessary link between the application of the private copying levy to the digital reproduction equipment, devices and media and their use for private copying, such that the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to all types of digital reproduction equipment, devices and media, including in the case where they are acquired by persons other than natural persons for purposes clearly unrelated to private copying, does not comply with Article 5(2) of Directive 2001/29 (Padawan, paragraphs 52 and 53). 29The system at issue in the main proceedings amounts to the indiscriminate application of the private copying levy to recording media suitable for reproduction, including in the case where the final use thereof does not fall within the case covered by Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29.  30The question therefore arises as to whether, in such a situation, a right to reimbursement of the levy paid allows the restoration of the fair balance which is to be struck, according to the requirements of Directive 2001/29, between the interests of the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction and those of the users of the protected subject-matter. 31In that regard, it must be held that a system of financing fair compensation consisting in the indiscriminate application of a private copying levy on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, together with such a right to reimbursement, provided that that right is effective and does not make it excessively difficult to repay the levy paid, may prove to be consistent with Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29, where the practical difficulties described in paragraph 24 of the present judgment or other similar difficulties justify its application. 32If a Member State has introduced a private copying exception into its national law, it must ensure, in accordance with its territorial competence, the effective recovery of the fair compensation for the harm suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction by reason of the reproduction of protected works by final users who reside on the territory of that State (see, to that effect, Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 36). Thus, where such recovery presents difficulties, the Member State concerned is also required to resolve them by taking into account the circumstances of each case.  33However, where there are no practical difficulties, or where such difficulties are not sufficient, the necessary link between the application of the private copying levy on media, on the one hand, and the use of those media for the purposes of private reproduction, on the other, is absent, so that the indiscriminate application of that levy is not justified and does not reflect the fair balance to be struck between the interests of the rightholders and those of the users of the protected subject-matter.  34It is for the national court to verify, in the light of the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by Directive 2001/29, whether the practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and, if so, whether the right to reimbursement of any levies paid in cases other than that under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 is effective and does not make repayment of those levies excessively difficult. 35In the present case, the referring court must verify, first of all, whether the indiscriminate application of a private copying levy on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction is warranted by sufficient practical difficulties in all cases. In that context, account must be taken of the scope, the effectiveness, the availability, the publicisation and the simplicity of use of the a priori exemption mentioned by Austro-Mechana in its written observations and at the hearing.  36Secondly, the referring court must also verify that the scope, the effectiveness, the availability, the publicisation and the simplicity of use of the right to reimbursement allow the correction of any imbalances created by the system in order to respond to the practical difficulties observed. In that regard, it must be observed that the referring court itself stresses that the cases of reimbursement are not limited to those expressly covered by Paragraph 42(b)(6) of the UrhG.  37In the light of the foregoing observations, the answer to the first question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in national territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision, where, having regard to the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by Directive 2001/29, which it is for the national court to verify, practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and the right to reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment of the levies paid excessively difficult. The second question 38Since the second question is dependent on the first question and the answer to the first question is a matter for the discretion of the referring court, the second question must also be answered.  39By its second question the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes the establishment by a Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of recording media suitable for reproduction in the case of the marketing of such media to natural persons, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy imposed on persons who first place such media on the market in their territory for commercial purposes and for consideration. 40In that regard, it must be held that, in the context of the wide discretion enjoyed by the Member States in determining the form, the detailed arrangements and the possible level of such compensation, it is legitimate for them to provide for presumptions, inter alia, as was observed in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, where the actual collection of the fair compensation to make good the damage suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction on their territory presents difficulties.  41In the context of systems of financing similar to that established by Paragraph 42b of the UrhG, the Court has held that, where the recording media capable of being used for reproduction have been made available to natural persons for private purposes it is unnecessary to show that they have in fact made private copies with the help of those media and have therefore actually caused harm to the holder of the exclusive right of reproduction, given that those natural persons are rightly presumed to benefit fully from the making available of those media, that is to say that they are deemed to take full advantage of the functions associated with that equipment, including copying (Padawan, paragraphs 54 and 55). 42The mere fact that those media are suitable for making copies is sufficient to justify the application of the private copying levy, provided that the media have been made available to natural persons as private users (Padawan, paragraph 56).  43Given the practical difficulties connected with the determination of the private purpose of the use of a recording medium suitable for reproduction, the establishment of a rebuttable presumption of such use when that medium is made available to a natural person is, in principle, justified and reflects the fair balance to be struck between the interests of the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction and those of the users of the protected subject-matter.  44It is for the national court to verify, in the light of the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by Directive 2001/29, whether the practical difficulties involved in determining whether the purpose of the use of the media at issue is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and, in any event, whether the presumption established results in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29.  45In those circumstances, the answer to the second question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy to be borne by persons who first place recording media suitable for reproduction on the market in the territory of the Member State concerned for commercial purposes and for consideration, that provision does not preclude the establishment by that Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of such media where they are marketed to natural persons, where the practical difficulties of determining whether the purpose of the use of the media in question is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and provided that the presumption established does not result in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in that provision. The third question 46By its third question, the referring court asks, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision, or the private copying levy intended to finance such compensation, may be excluded if half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levies is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled.  47In that connection, it must be borne in mind that the notion and level of fair compensation under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 are linked to the harm resulting for the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction from the reproduction for private use of their protected works without their authorisation. From that perspective, fair compensation must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by such rightholders and must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of the harm caused to them by the introduction of the private copying exception (Padawan, paragraphs 40 and 42).  48Moreover, the Court has held that, with regard to the right to fair compensation payable to holders of the exclusive right of reproduction under the private copying exception, it does not follow from any provision of Directive 2001/29 that the European Union legislature envisaged the possibility of that right being waived by the person entitled to it (jCase C277/10 Luksan [2012] ECR, paragraph 105).  49However, as the Advocate General observed in point 76 of his opinion, Directive 2001/29 does not require Member States which have introduced the private copying exception into their national law to pay those entitled to such fair compensation all the fair compensation in cash and does not preclude those Member States from providing, in the exercise of the wide discretion which they enjoy, that part of that compensation be provided in the form of indirect compensation. 50In that regard, the fact that the fair compensation must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by holders of the exclusive right of reproduction by reason of the introduction of the private copying exception, and must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of such harm, does not constitute an obstacle to the indirect payment to those entitled, through the intermediary of social and cultural establishments set up for their benefit, of a part of the revenue intended for fair compensation. 51Indeed, as the Advocate General observed in point 76 of his opinion, remuneration systems for private copying are at present necessarily imprecise with regard to most recording media, in that it is impossible in practice to determine which work was reproduced by which user and on which medium.  52Moreover, it must be observed that such a system of indirect collection of fair compensation by those entitled to it meets one of the objectives of the appropriate legal protection of intellectual property rights under Directive 2001/29, which is, as is apparent from recitals 10 and 11 of that directive, to ensure that European cultural creativity and production receive the necessary resources to continue their creative and artistic work and to safeguard the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers.  53Consequently, the fact that a part of the revenue intended for fair compensation under Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 is intended for social and cultural establishments set up for the benefit of those entitled to such compensation is not in itself contrary to the objective of that compensation, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify.  54It would not be consistent with the objective of that compensation for such establishments to grant their benefits to persons other than those entitled or to exclude, de jure or de facto, those who do not have the nationality of the Member State concerned.  55In the light of the foregoing observations, the answer to the third question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision or the private copying levy intended to finance that compensation cannot be excluded by reason of the fact that half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levy is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify. The fourth question 56By its fourth question, the referring court seeks to know, essentially, whether Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision, may be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.  57In that regard, it must be borne in mind that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 imposes on a Member State which has introduced the private copying exception into its national law an obligation to achieve a certain result, in the sense that that State must ensure, within the framework of its powers, that the fair compensation intended to compensate the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction harmed for the prejudice sustained is actually recovered, especially if that harm arose on the territory of that Member State (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 34).  58Since it is in principle for the final users who, for their private use, reproduce a protected work without seeking prior authorisation from the holder of the exclusive right of reproduction, thereby causing him harm, to make good that harm, it can be assumed that the harm for which reparation is to be made arose on the territory of the Member State in which those final users reside (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 35).  59It follows that, if a Member State has introduced an exception for private copying into its national law and if the final users who, on a private basis, reproduce a protected work reside on its territory, that Member State must ensure, in accordance with its territorial competence, the effective recovery of the fair compensation for the harm suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction on the territory of that State (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 36). 60Moreover, it must be recalled that the system of recovery chosen by the Member State concerned cannot relieve that Member State of the obligation to achieve the certain result of ensuring that the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction who have suffered harm actually receive payment of fair compensation for the prejudice which arose on its territory (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 39). 61In that regard, it is of no bearing on that obligation that, in the case of distance selling arrangements, the commercial seller who makes available reproduction equipment, devices and media to purchasers residing on the territory of that Member State, as final users, is established in another Member State (Stichting de Thuiskopie, paragraph 40). 62In the light of the fact that, as observed in paragraph 47 of the present judgment, fair compensation must be regarded as recompense for the harm suffered by the holders of the exclusive right of reproduction by reason of the introduction of the private copying exception and must necessarily be calculated on the basis of the criterion of such harm, it cannot be validly argued that the transfer from one Member State to another Member State of recording media suitable for reproduction can increase the harm caused to such rightholders. 63Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 provides for fair compensation, not for the placing on the market of recording media suitable for reproduction, but in respect of reproductions on any medium made by a natural person for private use and for ends that are neither directly nor indirectly commercial. There is no such reproduction in the case of a transfer from one Member State to another Member State of recording media suitable for reproduction. 64Given that a Member State which has introduced the private copying exception into its national law and in which the final users who privately reproduce a protected work live must ensure, in accordance with its territorial competence, the effective recovery of the fair compensation for the harm suffered by those entitled, the fact that a levy intended to finance that compensation has already been paid in another Member State cannot be relied on to exclude the payment in the first Member State of such compensation or of the levy intended to finance it.  65However, a person who has previously paid that levy in a Member State which does not have territorial competence may request its repayment in accordance with its national law.  66In the light of the foregoing observations, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision may not be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.  Costs 67Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.  On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude legislation of a Member State which indiscriminately applies a private copying levy on the first placing on the market in its territory, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, while at the same time providing for a right to reimbursement of the levies paid in the event that the final use of those media does not meet the criteria set out in that provision, where, having regard to the particular circumstances of each national system and the limits imposed by that directive, which it is for the national court to verify, practical difficulties justify such a system of financing fair compensation and the right to reimbursement is effective and does not make repayment of the levies paid excessively difficult. 2.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a system of financing of fair compensation under that provision by means of a private copying levy to be borne by persons who first place recording media suitable for reproduction on the market in the territory of the Member State concerned for commercial purposes and for consideration, that provision does not preclude the establishment by that Member State of a rebuttable presumption of private use of such media where they are marketed to natural persons, where the practical difficulties of determining whether the purpose of the use of the media in question is private justify the establishment of such a presumption and provided that the presumption established does not result in the imposition of the private copying levy in cases where the final use of those media clearly does not fall within the case referred to in that provision.  3.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to fair compensation under that provision or the private copying levy intended to finance that compensation cannot be excluded by reason of the fact that half of the funds received by way of such compensation or levy is paid, not directly to those entitled to such compensation, but to social and cultural institutions set up for the benefit of those entitled, provided that those social and cultural establishments actually benefit those entitled and the detailed arrangements for the operation of such establishments are not discriminatory, which it is for the national court to verify. 4.Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the obligation undertaken by a Member State to pay, on the placing on the market, for commercial purposes and for consideration, of recording media suitable for reproduction, a private copying levy intended to finance the fair compensation under that provision may not be excluded by reason of the fact that a comparable levy has already been paid in another Member State.

The idea is to replace the broken\\nfloppy drive with the new hard disk, but there seems to be some\\nproblems:\\n\\nThe internal SCSI cable and power cable inside the cx has only\\nconnectors for one single hard disk drive.\\n\\nIf I made a ribbon cable and a power cable with three connectors each\\n(1 for motherboard, 1 for each of the 2 disks), would it work?\\n\\nIs the IIcx able to supply the extra power to the extra disk?\\n\\nWhat about terminators? I suppose that i should remove the resistor\\npacks from the disk that is closest to the motherboard, but leave them\\ninstalled in the other disk.\\n\\nThe SCSI ID jumpers should also be changed so that the new disk gets\\nID #1.

According to the latest MacLeak, the \\ndrive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 MB/s sustained throughput (these figures\\nare from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of\\nperformance nonetheless). The drive was originally released for the PC\\nand just recently was released for the Mac world (don\\'t ask me what the \\ndifferences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according\\nto a Syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.\\nI have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in MacLeak\\nincluding PLI, MassMicro, ClubMac, and MacWarehouse\\'s PowerUser. The PLI\\nand MassMicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands\\nare going for around $750 for an external drive. Cartridges which hold \\n105 MB sell for about $80 each. At these prices, the drives and cartridges\\nare cheaper and better performing than the 88MB drives.\\nCost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and Bernoulli\\ndrives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more\\nreliable.  Personally, I\\'m excited by the new drive and look forward to \\ngetting my hands on one.\\n-Chris Wand\\n\\n-- \\n\\n\"Egotism is the anesthetic that dulls the pain of stupidity.\"\\n                                                     - Frank Leahy\\n')\n"
