      "Approach and landing is the most common phase of flight for \n",
      "\n",
      "aviation accidents, accounting annually for approximately 65 \n",
      "percent of all accidents. A Flight Safety Foundation study of \n",
      "16 years of runway excursions determined that 83 percent \n",
      "could have been avoided with a decision to go around. In \n",
      "other words, 54 percent of \n",
      "all accidents could potentially be \n",
      "prevented by going around. It is generally felt that an unstable \n",
      "\n",
      "approach is the primary cause of landing excursions. However, \n",

      "Many ALAs have been investigated thoroughly over time, and \n",

      "much is known about contributing factors. What is lacking, \n",

      "the psychology of noncompliance by flight crewmembers, and \n",
      "the other examined the psychology of management™s actions \n",
      "in handling company go-around policies. Detailed analysis can \n",
      "be found in the full report.\n",
      "For the go-around execution research, an accident and \n",

      "events were included. In some, the safety of the go-around \n",
      "was central to the accident or incident investigation; in oth\n",
      "-ers, the aftermath of the go-around was the main purpose of \n",
      "the investigation. The events involved single-aisle jets (64 \n",
      "percent), twin turboprops (20 percent) and twin-aisle jets \n",
      "(16 percent).\n",
      "The context, safety aspects and overall level of risk of each \n",
      "event were analyzed and characterized by a review team. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each event was assigned to one of three categories according \n",
      "to the degree of risk presented by the go-around: high risk (18 \n",

      "revealed weaknesses in all three attributes at the industry, \n",
      "operator and employee levels.\n",
      "High-level significant findings are:\n",
      "1. The collective industry norm is to accept the noncompli\n",
      "-ance of go-around polices, despite empirical data that \n",
      "\n",
      "indicate this is the most common contributor to ALAs.\n",
      "2. The industry predominantly turns to reducing unstable \n",
      "\n",
      "approaches as the sole means to reduce ALAs, even \n",
      "though empirical data show that unstable approaches \n",
      "affect less than half of runway excursions.\n",
      "3. Pilots™ overall awareness of ALA risks Š and of the impact \n",
      "\n",
      "those risks have on approach and landing safety Š is low.\n",
      "4. Management is generally disengaged from go-around \n",
